Título: Deep Learning (Part 1):Understanding Basic Neural Networks

2Description:This blog post aims to provide a basic understanding of neural networks, a fundamental concept in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Starting from the basics, we will explore the structure, functioning, and applications of neural networks. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to grasp the core concepts and unleash the potential of neural networks.Sections:Definition of neural networksDefinition of Deep learningHistory of Deep LearningBasic Neural NetworksHow does the Biological and Artificial Neuron work?Section- 1- Definition of neural networksDef: Neural networks, also called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are the backbone of deep learning algorithms. They are called “neural” because they mimic how neurons in the brain signal one another. People get a lot of ideas from nature — like planes, which were based off of birds [8]. For example, airplanes were invented inspired by birds[8]. A neural network is a type of machine-learning algorithm that is inspired by the human brain. It is a network of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that learn to recognize patterns in data.Def: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks in the human brain. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” that process and transmit information.Def: Artifiсial neural networks are соmрuting systems соnsisting оf densely interсоnneсted nоdes like neurоns in the brain. They are оrganized intо layers that transfоrm inрut data intо different reрresentatiоns by weighting inрuts, сalсulating sums, and aррlying nоn-linear aсtivatiоn funсtiоns until an оutрut is рrоduсed[10].Application: Complex machine-learning problems such as image classification, recommendation systems, and language-to-language translation have been solved with t
