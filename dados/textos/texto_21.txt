Título: The Building Blocks of Large Language Models

Language is the essence of human communication, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing how we interact with and leverage language through their remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like text. Delving into the building blocks of LLMs — vectors, tokens, and embeddings — unveils the intricate mechanisms that enable these models to process language with unprecedented sophistication.LLMs are transformative AI systems that have revolutionized the field of NLP. These models are capable of understanding, generating, and manipulating human-like text with remarkable fluency and coherence. At the core of LLMs lie fundamental building blocks that enable their remarkable performance: vectors, tokens, and embeddings. In this blog, I will delve into the intricacies of these components and explore how LLMs leverage them to process and generate language with unprecedented sophistication.1. Vectors: The Numerical Representation of LanguageIn the realm of LLMs, language is represented as numerical vectors, which are dense, high-dimensional arrays of real numbers. These vectors serve as the fundamental units of computation, allowing LLMs to perform mathematical operations on language in a way that captures its semantic and syntactic properties.1.1 One-Hot Encoding: The Traditional ApproachTraditionally, words or tokens in natural language were represented using a one-hot encoding scheme. In this approach, each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique index, and a vector of zeros is created with a length equal to the size of the vocabulary. The vector has a single value of 1 at the position corresponding to the word’s index, and zeros elsewhere.For example, if the vocabulary size is 10,000 words, and the word “cat” is assigned the index 237, its one-hot encoding would be a vector of length 10,000 with a 1 at position 237 and zeros everywhere else.While one-hot encoding is simple and intuitive, it suffers from several limitations. First, it creates high-di
