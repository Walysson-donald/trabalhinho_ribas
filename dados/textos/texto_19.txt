Título: Large Language Models [LLMs]

Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI models designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language. LLMs and GenAI (Generative AI) are a subset of machine learning focused on creating content that mimics human capabilities. LLMs are called “large” because they are trained with vast amounts of text data and contain billions or even trillions of parameters.These models, powered by trillions of words and extensive computational resources, exhibit remarkable language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving abilities. Foundation models, or base models, vary in size and complexity, with their capabilities expanding alongside the number of parameters.Parameters are the internal variables the model uses to predict what word comes next in a sentence.LLMs leverage massive training data, deep neural network architectures, and transformers to understand and generate human-like text, making them powerful tools for a wide range of applications in natural language processing, such as summarization, code generation, and chatbots.LLMs are trained using a technique called unsupervised learning. The training involves feeding the model examples of text and teaching it to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights) to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual next words in the training data. This process requires deep neural network architecture and substantial computational resources, especially as models become larger and trained on more data.The model learns from the data itself without needing explicit labels for each example using what is known as unsupervised learning.Once trained, LLMs can understand the prompt — an input to the model — make inferences to generate text, answer questions, summarize or expand information, translate languages, generate code, and even compute mathematical functions — output of the model.Interacting with LLMs requir
