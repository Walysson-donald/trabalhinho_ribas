Título: In-depth tutorial of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long - Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

1Although, research papers are best way to learn about any cutting edge technology, however, it is not very easy to understand them. It has lot of mathematical equations and terminologies which requires lots of effort.artpal.comHence, I will try my best to explain RNN in very structured format but if you face any difficulty, please let me know by writing in comment box at the end. So, are you READY!, Lets’ Start!facebook.comWhat is RNN???RNN are a class of neural networks that is powerful for modeling sequence data such as time series or natural language. Basically, main idea behind this architecture is to use sequential information.Do you know how Google’s autocomplete function works???Basically, collection of large volumes of most frequently occurring consecutive words fed into =======>> RNN network =======>> It analyze the data by finding the sequence of words occurring frequently and builds a model to predict the next word in the sentence.So, do you see the importance of the RNN in our daily life. Actually, it has made us lazy!We already have so many problems in life, now why to make it more complex by introducing a new network (RNN), when we already have feed forward neural network?In feed forward neural network, information flows only in forward direction from the input nodes, through the hidden layers and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.Feed Forward Neural Network classifying two outputs.Issues in the feed forward neural network : -Can’t handle sequential data.Consider only current input.Can’t memorize the previous input.Basic Architecture of RNNSo, from above figure, it is clear that RNN is a special type of feed forward neural network. As explained by the diagram, in RNN, the output of any layer not only depends on the current input but also on the set of inputs that have came before. This special feature provides it a significant advantage over other neural networks by taking help of inputs obtained before to predict output
