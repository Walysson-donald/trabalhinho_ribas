12Essential Deep Learning Concepts Explained IntuitivelyImage Source: AuthorAre you new to deep learning and looking for a comprehensive guide to help you understand the basics and beyond? Look no further! In this article, we will delve into 20 essential deep learning concepts, starting with the basics and gradually moving on to more advanced topics. From Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to Gradient Descent and Activation Functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, SoftMax), we will explore everything you need to know to gain a solid foundation in deep learning. So, grab your coffee and let’s get started!Neurons:Image Source: MediumA neuron is a basic building block of a neural network. It’s like a tiny computer that can perform simple calculations and make decisions based on inputs. Neurons are connected to each other in a network, and they work together to perform complex tasks, such as image classification or language translation. The inputs to a neuron are numbers that represent the information, and the output of a neuron is a decision about what to do with that information.Example: Let’s say you have a group of friends, and you want to play a game of “Telephone”. In this game, one person whispers a message to the next person, and so on, until the message has been passed to everyone in the group. Each person in the group is like a neuron in a neural network, receiving information from one person and passing it.Activation Function (Sigmoid, ReLU, SoftMax)The activation function is like a gatekeeper for each neuron in the ANN. It decides whether a neuron should be “turned on” or “turned off.” Different types of activation functions perform this decision-making process in different ways.Sigmoid:Image Source: WikipediaThe sigmoid function is like a light switch. It turns the neuron on or off based on the input. If the input is above a certain threshold, the sigmoid function outputs a value of 1, which turns the neuron on. If the input is below the threshold, the sigmoid function outpu
